# Salt API project
This application is a one-day project I made for presenting in the "Hack Day" of Salt Bootcamp.
We had one day to make the frontend, the backend and the database. The application uses an external API to
show, save, and delete questions and aswers as a trivial-like game.
Tech stack:
   - Frontend: React.js
   - Backend: Java Spring Boot
   - DataBase: PostgreSQL
   - External API used https://api-ninjas.com/api/trivia
   
It has the basic functionality of the design:

But there are more functionality to add in the future versions. Some of them are:
  - Add a countdown timer to answer
  - Add a dropdown selector for categories on MytriviAPP
  - Add am input box to answer and let the app to check if the answer is correct
  - Add animations and music
  - Save the wrong answers automatically
  - Mobile version
