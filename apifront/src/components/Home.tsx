                    <p>This application is a one-day project I made for presenting in the "Hack Day" of Salt Bootcamp.
                        We had one day to make the frontend, the backend and the database. The application uses an
                        external API to show, save, and delete questions and aswers as a trivial-like game.</p>
                    <p>Enjoy and have fun!</p>
